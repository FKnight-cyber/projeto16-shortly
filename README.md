# Driven Education

## Project 16 Shortly

In this full-stack project we had to develop a back-end using nodejs following a given documentation to an app that shorten Urls and shows ranking
of users with most views in their shortened Urls.

The database had to be made using PostgreSQL and a dump had to be added.

The front-end was a bonus, we had figma as basement and from there we should think in routes to integrate with the back-end, it was developed using Reactjs
and many fun libs.
